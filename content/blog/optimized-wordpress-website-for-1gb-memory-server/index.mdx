### Adjusting PHP-FPM for Performance + Low Memory

PHP-FPM has as a default configuration that uses more memory than necessary. It
has spare php-fpm processes ready to go, taking up memory in case there is PHP
code to process. While not a problem if you have tons of RAM, it can be an issue
for low RAM VPS and if you are using aggressive page caching then it is memory
being used unnecessarily that could be used by MariaDB MySQL or other critical
processes. I always use nginx with PHP-FPM running PHP 7.0 (or the latest
version) so this tutorial explains how to tweak the configuration to use as
little RAM as possible.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
```

Change `pm = dynamic` to `pm = ondemand`

Comment `pm.start_servers`, `pm.min_spare_servers` and `pm.max_spare_servers`

Then comment out for `pm.process_idle_timeout` and `pm.max_requests`

### Adjusting Mysql and MariaDB

```bash
[mysqld]
symbolic-links=0
skip-external-locking
key_buffer_size = 32K
max_allowed_packet = 4M
table_open_cache = 8
sort_buffer_size = 128K
read_buffer_size = 512K
read_rnd_buffer_size = 512K
net_buffer_length = 4K
thread_stack = 480K
innodb_file_per_table
max_connections=100
max_user_connections=50
wait_timeout=50
interactive_timeout=50
long_query_time=5
```
