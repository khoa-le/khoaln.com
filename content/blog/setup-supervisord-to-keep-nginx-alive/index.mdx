In some cases in the production environment, we faced downtime of the website,
Nginx process disappeared. We want to keep the Nginx always alive without any
reasons. So, we use the Supervisord as a supervisor who make sure Nginx is
always alive

### Add Nginx configuration on Supervisord

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/supervisor/conf.d/nginx.conf

[program:nginx]
command=/usr/sbin/nginx -g "daemon off;"
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=5
numprocs=1
startsecs=0
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/%(program_name)s_stderr.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/%(program_name)s_stdout.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=10MB

```

Let supervisord know about new config.

```shell
$ sudo supervisorctl reread
nginx: available
```

Let supervisord start nginx service

```shell
$ sudo supervisorctl update
nginx: added process group
```

Verify if supervisor started nginx service.

```shell
sudo supervisorctl
nginx:nginx_00
supervisor>
```

Then done, you can try to stop the nginx service and you see the new Nginx's
proccess always start the new one.
