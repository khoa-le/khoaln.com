*How we replaced Google Sheets with a custom Laravel resource management system for a 15-person engineering team across 6 Asian branches.*

---

## The Problem

Managing engineering resources across multiple offices shouldn't require a PhD in spreadsheet gymnastics. Yet that's exactly where we found ourselves — tracking 15 developers across 6 branches using nothing but Google Sheets and hope.

Our team, split between Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, and other Asian offices, was drowning in the gap between "who's available" and "who's actually working on what." The spreadsheets weren't just inconvenient — they were silently hiding over-allocation disasters, manual data entry errors, and zero visibility into upcoming capacity crunches.

**The breaking points:**
- Developers assigned 150%+ capacity across overlapping projects
- "Spot" projects (urgent, fixed-deadline work) mixed with ongoing retainer work with no distinction
- Slack questions like "is anyone free next week?" eating hours of management time
- Zero mobile access — try using a spreadsheet on your phone during a client call

We needed something better. So we built it.

## What We Built

**Team Resource Manager** is an open-source capacity planning platform built with Laravel 11, Vue.js 3, and Inertia.js. It handles developer assignments, project tracking, capacity forecasting, and Slack integration — all with a mobile-first design that actually works on phones.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Laravel 11 + Inertia.js |
| Frontend | Vue.js 3 + TailwindCSS |
| Database | SQLite (dev) / MySQL (production) |
| Design System | Turbopuffer (custom CSS variables) |
| Charts | Chart.js for capacity forecasting |
| Testing | PHPUnit (150+ tests, 699 assertions) |
| Bot Testing | CLI-first (`php artisan bot:test`) — no Slack required |

## Key Features & Design Decisions

### 1. Over-Allocation Is Allowed (With Warnings)

Traditional resource tools block you from assigning developers past 100% capacity. We deliberately rejected this approach.

**Why?** Because in the real world, you sometimes need 150% allocation for short periods. A developer might be wrapping up one project at 50% while ramping up another 80%. Blocking this creates artificial constraints.

Instead, we built **tiered warnings:**

- 🟢 **Ok** (≤100%): Smooth sailing
- 🟡 **Warning** (100-120%): Proceed with caution
- 🔴 **Danger** (>120%): Flag for immediate review

The system creates the assignment in all cases — it just warns appropriately. This respects operational reality while maintaining visibility.

---

### 2. Project Types: Regular vs Spot

Not all projects are equal. We split them into two distinct types with different date semantics:

**Regular projects** have *proposed* dates — flexible, planning-phase timing that can shift.

**Spot projects** have *committed* start and end dates — hard deadlines, often client-driven, with a ⚡ visual indicator in the UI.

This lets us forecast differently. Spot projects are non-negotiable blocks of time. Regular projects are movable. The capacity forecast shows spot hours separately, so you can see exactly how much flexibility you have.

---

### 3. Master Data Management (Database-Driven Config)

Hardcoded enums are a maintenance nightmare. We replaced every dropdown with database tables:

- `master_roles` (frontend, backend, fullstack, devops, PM, QC)
- `master_levels` (junior, mid, senior, lead)
- `master_project_statuses` (proposed, confirmed, active, completed, on_hold)
- `master_priorities` (low, medium, high, urgent)
- `master_clients` (client list for project creation)
- `master_project_types` (regular, spot)

**Why this matters:** Non-technical admins can add new roles, statuses, or clients without touching code. Validations dynamically pull from these tables, so the system stays configurable.

**Caching strategy:** 1-hour TTL with auto-clear on any master data update.

---

### 4. CLI-Testable Slack Bot

We built a Slack bot for common queries: `/assign`, `/whoisfree`, `/myschedule`, `/projects`. But waiting for Slack approval to test bot commands is painful.

**Solution:** Every bot command is testable via CLI:

```bash
# Test the assign command without Slack
php artisan bot:test assign \
  --args="Le Ba Hung|AEC|backend" \
  --user=admin \
  --dry-run
```

The `--args` parameter uses pipe separators so multi-word names don't break. `--dry-run` wraps everything in a transaction and rolls back, so you can test without polluting the database.

---

### 5. Mobile-First Responsive Design

Engineering managers check capacity on their phones during commutes, client calls, and off-hours. We audited every page at 375px–390px widths (iPhone SE/14 sizes) and fixed 7 critical mobile issues:

1. **Projects meta grid** — replaced `divide-x` with conditional `nth-child` borders
2. **Capacity 5-card grid** — removed broken `md:grid-cols-3` breakpoint
3. **Assignment "Copied from" banner** — stacks vertically on mobile
4. **Forecast chart legend** — wraps below title on narrow screens
5. **Forms with dual columns** — single column below 640px
6. **Flash messages** — long warnings wrap with `break-words`
7. **Project type radio cards** — full width on mobile

**Verification:** Puppeteer screenshot automation at 4 breakpoints — 24 screenshots, zero horizontal overflow warnings.

---

### 6. Capacity Forecasting with Charts

The forecast page shows 12-week weekly or 6-month monthly views:

- **Frontend vs Backend split** — capacity and utilization tracked separately
- **Spot vs Ongoing hours** — stacked in charts to show committed vs flexible work
- **Over-allocation indicators** — red badges when utilization >100%

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Constants Over Magic Numbers

We extracted all scheduling constants into a `HasWorkScheduleConstants` trait:

```php
protected const WORK_HOURS_PER_DAY = 8;
protected const WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5;
protected const HOURS_PER_WEEK = 40;
protected const ALLOCATION_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 100;
protected const ALLOCATION_DANGER_THRESHOLD = 120;
```

This eliminates magic numbers like `* 5 * 8` scattered through forecasting calculations.

---

### Defensive Coding

**Lazy loading protection:** Laravel's `Model::preventLazyLoading()` caught a missing `->with('developer')` during a refactor — we fixed it immediately with eager loading.

**Infinite recursion guard:** Added `$depth` parameter to prevent runaway recursion in capacity suggestion logic.

---

## Testing Strategy

We wrote 150+ tests covering:

- **Unit:** Services, traits, and models
- **Feature:** HTTP endpoints, form submissions, over-allocation flows
- **Mobile:** Puppeteer screenshot automation at 4 breakpoints
- **Regression:** Specific bugs have dedicated tests

All tests pass with `--no-coverage` in ~60 seconds on a modest VM.

## Open Source & Hiring

Team Resource Manager is open-source.

**Want something similar?** We build custom resource management and capacity planning tools for engineering teams. If you're drowning in spreadsheets and need real-time visibility into who's working on what, let's talk.
