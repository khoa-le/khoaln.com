Laravel worker should always run on the production environment to serve the jobs
that application send to. To keep the process running, we use the Supervisord to
help

### Add Laravel Worker configuration on Supervisord

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/supervisor/conf.d/laravel-worker.conf

[program:laravel-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php8.1 /home/forge/your-project/artisan queue:listen database --sleep=3 --tries=3
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=forge
numprocs=1
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/.forge/laravel-worker.log

```

Let supervisord know about new config.

```shell
$ sudo supervisorctl reread
laravel-worker: available
```

Let supervisord start worker

```shell
$ sudo supervisorctl update
laravel-worker: added process group
```

Verify if supervisor started worker .

```shell
sudo supervisorctl
laravel-worker:laravel-worker_00
supervisor>
```
